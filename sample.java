// Time Complexity : O(2*n)
// Space Complexity : O(1) bcoz we are storing alphabets in HAshmap
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this :No


// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
//First store all the characters in HashMAp then we will get to know the last index of each character
//take start and end pointer then 
//based on window update the start and end pointer.
