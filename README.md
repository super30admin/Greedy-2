## Problem1 Queue Reconstruction by Height (https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

 
Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

## Problem2 Partition Labels (https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)

A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:

a - 

Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"

Output: [9,7,8]

Explanation:

The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

Note:

S will have length in range [1, 500].

S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.
